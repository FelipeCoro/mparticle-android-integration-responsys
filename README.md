## Responsys Kit Integration



This repository contains the [Responsys](https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCFB/) integration for the [mParticle Android SDK](https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-android-sdk).

### Adding the integration
1. The Responsys Kit is available via Maven Central. For adding the Responsys SDK, refer to  the [Step-by-Step guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/marketing/responsys-develop-mobile/android/step-by-step/) and follow steps [1.1] through [3.4] and step [4.5].

    >
	> NOTE: In **step [2.2]**, download your app's **pushio_config.json** file, however, this does not need to be added to your app, you will need its contents to create the Responsys Connection in your mParticle workspace.
    >

2. Follow [mParticle's push registration guide](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/android/push-notifications#register-for-push-notifications) to ensure you're properly registering for push with mParticle.

3. Add the kit dependency to your app's build.gradle:
    ```
    dependencies {
    		implementation 'com.mparticle:android-responsys-kit:5+'
    }
    ```
    >
    > NOTE: as of version `android-responsys-kit` version 5.12.11, the Responsys SDK (v6.4.4) requires AndroidX. For more information, [see here](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate)
    >
4. Reference mParticle's integration docs below to enable the Responsys Connection.
5. Once enabled, rebuild and launch your app, and verify that you see `"Responsys Kit detected"` in the output of `adb logcat`.
6. To enable additional features of the Responsys SDK like In-App Messaging, Notification Preferences etc., follow the respective guides available [here](https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCFB/android/).
